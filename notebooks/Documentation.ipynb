    "Abstract—As drone attracts much interest, the drone industryhas opened their market to ordinary people, making drones tobe used in daily lives. However, as it got easier for drone to\n",

    "as accidents are much more likely to happen: colliding into\n",
    "people by losing control or invading secured properties. For safety\n",
    "purposes, it is essential for observers and drone to be aware of an\n",
    "approaching drone. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive\n",
    "drone detection system based on machine learning. This system\n",
    "is designed to be operable on drones with camera. Based on the\n",
    "camera images, the system deduces location on image and vendor\n",
    "model of drone based on machine classification. The system is\n",
    "actually built with OpenCV library. We collected drone imagery\n",
    "and information for learning process. The system’s output shows\n",
    "about 89 percent accuracy.\n",

    "As the use of drones has raised in the city, the regula-\n",

    "Drones are increasing in popularity, this brings an onset of difficulties such as attacks, accidents by colliding into people by losing control and invading secured properties. For safety purposes, it is essential for observers to be aware of an approaching drone and eliminate the threats, if any. In this project, we aim at solving the issue of drones passing secure/restricted areas. This is done through the use of Image processing and DL. The system detects, identifies and jams the drone; the detection of various object is done by a selective segementation algorithm which comes out the box in the OpenCV library; then the identification and labeling of the detected objects is  done by a VGG16 Neural Net, trained on the following mentioned dataset finally the jamming is done by initiating a deauthourization or beacon attack. The dataset consists of various images ofdrones, our own dataset and combining it with existing public datasets. The system is proposed to be tested under various conditions and different environments."
